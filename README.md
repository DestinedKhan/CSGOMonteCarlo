# CSGOMonteCarlo
A Monte Carlo simulation built using Python and Matplotlib.

This program opens 1000 Operation Pheonix 'cases' each time it is run and shows the grouping of likely
outcomes if the number the user puts in is large enough. The values will at one point
be scraped using BeautifulSoup4 and the prices acquired that way.
